20:05 < ceene> buildroot lets me choose among this, and later on it lets me choose hf and thumb
20:05 < ceene> arm920t arm922t arm926t arm1136j-s arm1136jf-s arm1176jz-s arm1176jzf-s mpcore 
               cortex-A5 cortex-A7 cortex-A8 cortex-A9 cortex-A12 cortex-A15 cortex-M3 fa526/626 
               pj4 strongarm sa110/sa1100 xscale iwmmxt
20:05 < ceene> i don't know which of these should I choose
20:06 < freemangordon> cortex-a8
20:06 < ceene> cool, thanks!
20:06 < ceene> now it lets me choose EABI or EABIhf, I'll test both
20:07 < ceene> and also "floating point strategy" which can be soft float, VFPv2, VFPv3, VFPv3-D16 
               and NEON
20:07 < freemangordon> NEON
20:07 < ceene> and later on, ARM vs Thumb2
20:07 < freemangordon> which kernel?
20:07 < freemangordon> 4.4?
20:08 < ceene> yes, i'll be compiling Pali's one
20:08 < freemangordon> thumb2 then
20:08 < ceene> ok!
20:08 < freemangordon> ceene: you build debian, correct?
20:08 < ceene> no, not right now
20:08 < freemangordon> what are you doing then?
20:08 < ceene> i'm using buildroot to build a very basic rootfs
20:09 < ceene> just a shell and little else
20:09 < freemangordon> still, the same
20:09 < ceene> and little by little i'll be adding things
20:09 < freemangordon> you'd better choose EABIhf
20:09 < ceene> although first thing will be trying to boot maemo with this kernel
20:09 < freemangordon> ceene: you need to do some thing to maemo to be able to boot it with 
                       upstream kernels
20:10 < ceene> it wonï¿½'t boot by default?
20:10 < freemangordon> no
20:10 < ceene> oh
20:10 < ceene> what needs to be done?
20:10 < ceene> is it written somewhere?
20:10 < Pali> for n900 use gcc flags: -march=armv7-a -mcpu=cortex-a8 -mtune=cortex-a8 -mfpu=neon
20:11 < Pali> for thumb build add flags: -mthumb -mno-thumb-interwork
20:11 < Pali> and for hardfp add: mfloat-abi=hard
20:12 < freemangordon> -mno-thumb-interwork is by default iirc
20:12 < freemangordon> but doesn;t hurt either to add it
20:12 < ceene> ok
20:13 < freemangordon> ceene: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/24/469
20:13 < Pali> for softfp use instead: -mfloat-abi=softfp (needed for Maemo5)
20:13 < ceene> great, thanks!
20:13 < freemangordon> ceene: but!!!
20:13 < Pali> ceene: do not change /etc/event.d/sgx file (as written in that LKML post)
20:14 < ceene> ok
20:14 < freemangordon> ceene: there is still a nasty bug that ruins onenand fs after the first 
                       powerdown/reboot
20:14 < ceene> oh
20:14 < freemangordon> so you'd better not try it now :)
20:14 < ceene> lol
20:15 < ceene> ok
20:15 < ceene> but flashing again will fix it, won't it?
20:15 < freemangordon> sure
20:15 < ceene> ok, then i don't mind
20:15 < ceene> that's why I bought this new n900 :)
20:15 < ceene> i want to help you guys test all of this :)
20:15 < freemangordon> cool. who know, you may even find that bug :)
20:16 < freemangordon> knows even

Create new file /etc/event.d/userspace-fixes with content:

start on started hildon-desktop
service
console none
script
	if ! hal-device /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_soc_audio_logicaldev_input 2> /dev/null; then
		hal-device --add /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_soc_audio_logicaldev_input < /dev/null
		hal-set-property --udi /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_soc_audio_logicaldev_input --key input.jack.type --strlist-pre "a"
		hal-set-property --udi /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/platform_soc_audio_logicaldev_input --key input.jack.type --strlist-rem "a"
	fi
end script

cmt_speech isn't automatically loaded, so you must add it to /etc/modules
wl1251 is looking for firmware on a subdirectory, so a link is needed:
mkdir -p /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity; ln -s /lib/firmware/wl* /lib/firmware/ti-connectivity


The N900 has several watchdogs that can be disabled by NOLO R&D flags.
If they are kept enabled, they are standard watchdogs (see kernel's Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt)
Busybox has support for /dev/watchdog devices and buildroot is able to set a daemon to reset them.
There is also ioctl for disabling watchdog (and our drivers and HW support it).
Pali's bootmenu also supports it: https://garage.maemo.org/plugins/ggit/browse.php/?p=bootmenu;a=blob;f=src/watchdogs.c
On this code, libcal is used only to check if R&D mode is enabled

The way to boot output/zImage.omap-n900 with a filesystem on ram is this:
  0xFFFF -m kernel:zImage.omap3-n900 -m initfs:rootfs.ext2 -l -b 'rootdelay root=/dev/ram0 panic=5'

If there's no watchdog daemon on your userspace, you'll want to disable them by enabling R&D mode:
  0xFFFF -m kernel:zImage.omap3-n900 -m initfs:rootfs.ext2 -l -b 'rootdelay root=/dev/ram0 panic=5' -R 1 -F no-omap-wd,no-ext-wd,no-lifeguard-reset

To export one file as usb mass storage:
echo path > /sys/devices/platform/68000000.ocp/480ab000.usb_otg_hs/musb-hdrc.0.auto/gadget/lun0/file

Things to do:
Red parts on http://elinux.org/N900
20:57 < Pali> status about camera: does not work for unknown reason
20:57 < Pali> broken between v3.5 and v3.8
20:58 < ceene> that should be at least bisectable?
20:58 < Pali> very very hard, but should be
20:59 < Pali> camera support in those versions was not part of mainline kernel
20:59 < ceene> i guess it exposes a video4linux device
20:59 < Pali> so bisecting would mean to apply all patches on top of commit for testing
20:59 < Pali> ceene: yes v4l2 device
20:59 < ceene> so maybe it's somewhat easier to read the datasheet and try to find any discrepancies
20:59 < Pali> but it use mediactl for config
21:00 < Pali> problem is that camera do not send data
21:00 < ceene> doesn't answer to anything or is it only video that is not working?
21:01 < Pali> ceene: camera do not send any data
21:02 < Pali> bluetooth status: original nokia driver was rejected and sre written new one (which use correct api), but for unknown reason do not 
              work, just send unknown error
21:03 < Pali> ceene: what is missing is also ir driver
21:04 < Pali> driver is in mainline kernel but needs fixing for multiarch API
21:04 < Pali> yes, that rx51 cir driver
21:06 < Pali> ceene: that ir-rx51.c should be the easiest missing part
21:06 < Pali> some info on https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/1/2/61
21:09 < Pali> or something different... fix tidspbridge driver (for DSP video hw accel), currently there are compile errors so it is disabled
21:09 < Pali> on older kernels when there were no compile errors I think it worked
21:12 < Pali> ceene: for enabling tidspbridge add these config options: CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE=m CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE_DVFS=y 
              CONFIG_TIDSPBRIDGE_MEMPOOL_SIZE=0x600000


13:09 < Wizzup> HRH_H_Crab: hi there
13:09 < Wizzup> I have gotten audio to work on 4.3 and 4.5 from Pali
13:09 < Wizzup> You mostly just need to tweak a few ALSA settings
13:10 < Wizzup> I have them documented here somewhere...
13:10 < Wizzup> Right, see: http://sprunge.us/aPeU
13:10 < Wizzup> Specifically the last two items are important
13:10 < Wizzup> (just the volume change is not so important)
13:11 < Wizzup> Hm, I recall there being more changes. Well, see if you can figure it out with this. If not, let me know
13:11 < Wizzup> You can use amixer to dump the current config - that's how I made the diff
